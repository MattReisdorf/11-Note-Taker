## Installation

Install the Following Dependencies:
Node.js is required to run the backend server, as well as using the 'fs' and 'path' modules used in the server file. I also recommend installing nodemon if you want to do any work on this repo; it will auto restart the server for you. 

Testing Functionallity:
Since this was a boilerplate homework, no tests were done

## Usage

Feel free to fork if you want, but I won't be accepting any commits into this repo.
